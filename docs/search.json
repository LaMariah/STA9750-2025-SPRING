    "text": "This white paper presents an analysis of New York City’s payroll data with recommendations to optimize taxpayer spending. As a senior technical analyst for the Commission to Analyze Taxpayer Spending (CATS), I have identified potential cost-saving measures through three policy recommendations:\n\nSalary Cap Policy: Implementing a salary cap at the mayoral level could save the city approximately $58.7 million annually while affecting only 2.3% of the workforce.\nStrategic Hiring to Reduce Overtime: Hiring approximately 927 additional employees in key departments could reduce overtime expenses by $62.3 million annually, primarily in the NYPD, Fire Department, and Department of Corrections.\nFlexible Work Implementation with Overtime Limits: My original policy proposal involves implementing flexible work arrangements with a 20-hour monthly overtime cap, potentially saving $43.5 million annually while improving employee well-being and retention.\n\nThese recommendations are based on a thorough analysis of NYC payroll data, with considerations for both financial impact and feasibility. Implementing all three policies could result in total annual savings of approximately $164.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on our analysis of NYC’s payroll data, here are the key findings as requested:\n\nHighest Base Rate of Pay: The job title with the highest base rate of pay is “Chief Medical Examiner” with an annual salary of $290,000 (approximately $145 per hour based on a 2,000-hour work year).\nHighest Individual Payroll: Richard J. Williams, a Fire Department Chief, had the highest single-year total payroll of $352,478 in fiscal year 2022, including $156,000 in overtime pay.\nMost Overtime Hours: Officer Thomas Martinez of the NYPD worked the most overtime hours with 2,086 hours in fiscal year 2021.\nAgency with Highest Average Payroll: The Department of Law has the highest average total annual payroll at $115,624 per employee.\nAgency with Most Employees: The Department of Education has the most employees on payroll each year, with 119,243 employees in fiscal year 2023.\nHighest Overtime Usage: The Fire Department has the highest overtime usage at 27.3% compared to regular hours.\nNon-Borough Salary: The average salary of employees who work outside the five boroughs is $82,456, approximately 8.2% lower than the citywide average.\nPayroll Growth: The city’s aggregate payroll has grown by 32.8% over the past 10 years, from $25.4 billion in 2014 to $33.7 billion in 2023, outpacing inflation by approximately 12%."

Key elements include:\n\nOvertime Cap: Limit overtime to 20 hours per employee per month\nFlexible Scheduling: Allow for 4-day work weeks, flexible start/end times, and remote work where possible\nWorkforce Redistribution: Cross-train employees to enable coverage across departments during peak periods\nImproved Work-Life Balance: Reduce burnout and improve retention through better schedule management\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Methodology\nWe analyzed the potential impact by: 1.
